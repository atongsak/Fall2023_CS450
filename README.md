# CS 450 - Introduction to Computer Graphics

Here are all my projects from CS 450 - Introduction to Computer Graphics with Dr. Mike Bailey. I learned a lot about the graphics pipeline and how to implement iconic CG effects, from lighting to texture mapping to shaders, in C++ with OpenGL and GLSL. 

Check out my pdfs folder to read about my approach to each project!

## Draw Something Cool in 3D!

To kick off our exploration into computer graphics, everyone was tasked with drawing something cool using OpenGL. I decided to make Doraemon out of OSU spheres, cylinders, curved line strips, and BoxLists! I call this piece "Doraemon Coming Out of Nobita's Desk."

## Keytime Animation

This is another project where we had free range to do whatever we wanted as long as we met the requirements. We had to animate 8 quantities, each with at least 6 defining keytimes. I'm really proud of this one!

## Final Project - Random Cobweb Generator

Inspired by a video of Pixar's cobweb generation program for <i>Toy Story 4</i>, I created a cobweb generator for my final project. I referenced DreamWorks' 2011 paper, <a href="https://research.dreamworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/63-lee-Edited.pdf" target="_blank">"Building and Animating Cobwebs for Antique Sets,"</a> as well as <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4177154/find-equation-for-a-parabolic-line-that-goes-through-two-points-in-3d-space">a Stack Exchange discussion</a> to achieve similar results in OpenGL. This project taught me a lot about the math behind implementing parabolas in 3D space.
